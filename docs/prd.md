It should also have production planning tools to optimize schedules and improve operational performance. Sales and CRM features should be incorporated to manage customer relationships and orders. Keg and container tracking should be implemented for efficient distribution. The system should provide real-time analytics and reporting capabilities for data-driven decision-making. It should integrate seamlessly with other platforms and systems used in the brewery. The system should be cloud-based and accessible from any device. Advanced quality control mechanisms should be incorporated, such as high-quality basic instrumentation, a good sensory program, and proper methods based on industry standards. Ongoing technical support, updates, and enhancements should be offered based on user feedback and industry requirements.
