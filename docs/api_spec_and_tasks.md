## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the application. Initializes the Flask app and the database."),
    ("config.py", "Contains the configuration settings for the Flask app and the database."),
    ("models.py", "Defines the database models for User, Inventory, Production, Sales, and Keg."),
    ("views.py", "Defines the routes and views for the Flask app."),
    ("forms.py", "Defines the forms used in the Flask app."),
    ("tests.py", "Contains the tests for the application."),
    ("Dockerfile", "Defines the Docker container for the application.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "config.py",
    "models.py",
    "forms.py",
    "views.py",
    "main.py",
    "tests.py",
    "Dockerfile"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'config.py' contains the configuration settings for the Flask app and the database. It should be set up first to ensure the correct settings are in place.

'models.py' defines the database models for User, Inventory, Production, Sales, and Keg. These models are used throughout the application, so they should be set up early in the development process.

'forms.py' defines the forms used in the Flask app. These forms are used in the views to handle user input.

'views.py' defines the routes and views for the Flask app. It uses the models and forms to handle requests and render responses.

'main.py' is the main entry point of the application. It initializes the Flask app and the database, and should be set up after the other files have been created.

'tests.py' contains the tests for the application. It should be updated continuously as the application is developed.

'Dockerfile' defines the Docker container for the application. It should be set up last, after the application has been developed and tested.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
We need to clarify the deployment process, specifically how to set up the Docker container and deploy it on a cloud platform like AWS.
